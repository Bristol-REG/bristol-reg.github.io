We now have around 30 members, including from the [JGI](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/), [ACRC](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/), [Research IT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research-it/), [Bristol Centre for Supercomputing](https://isambard.ac.uk/), [LEAP digital health hub](https://leap-hub.ac.uk/), and embedded researchers across the University.

## How to get involved

* **Slack channel** [#bristol-rse](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/GUJK4P918) on the UK RSE slack instance. If you aren’t a member then please [sign up](https://ukrse.slack.com/signup?redir=%2Farchives%2FGUJK4P918%3Fname%3DGUJK4P918#/domain-signup) and email for an invite to the channel. We’d like to encourage use of this for peer-support (and cat photos!) The UK RSE slack also brings together the UK-wide RSE + friends community. If you're new, then there are lots of helpful channels on this Slack instance and it's a very active community.

* **Mailing list** [grp-ResearchEngineering](https://outlook.office.com/groups/groups.bristol.ac.uk/grp-ResearchEngineering/mail) which also has a group calendar for our meetings (and somewhere to store all the documents linked to below).

* **Group meetings** (optional) hybrid in Royal Fort House every two weeks, currently Wednesday mornings.

* **Research computing training** for data science and RSE. [Self-led courses on GitHub](https://bristol-training.github.io/) plus we run in-person and online courses during the year. Volunteer helpers welcome!

* **Reading group** - currently reading Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath, hybrid in Royal Fort House and on MS Teams, roughly every two weeks.

* **Today I Learned (TIL)** [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JGIBristol/TIL) – for making interesting things we talk about on Slack more permanent, with minimal fuss. See the ‘contributing TILs’ for instructions.

* **Data Science Handbook** [GitHub website](https://jgibristol.github.io/data-science-handbook/) – in development and contributions welcome!

## Also from the JGI

* **Data Ethics Club** online [journal club](https://dataethicsclub.com/) about doing data science ethically, every two weeks.

* **Alan Turing Institute** [liaison academics](https://bristol.ac.uk/golding/turing-institute/) linking us to the wider Turing network and interest groups, for example.
