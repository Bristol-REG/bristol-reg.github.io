    "text": "How to get involved\nOur main communication via the Slack channel #bristol-rse on the UK RSE slack instance. If you aren’t a member then please sign up to Slack and email us for an invite to the channel. We’d like to encourage use of this for peer-support (and cat photos!) The UK RSE slack also brings together the UK-wide RSE + friends community. If you’re new, then there are lots of helpful channels on this Slack instance and it’s a very active community.\nWe also have:\n\nMailing list grp-ResearchEngineering which also has a group calendar for our meetings (and somewhere to store all the documents linked to below). We’ll add you to this at the same time as the Slack channel.\nGroup meetings (optional) hybrid in Royal Fort House every two weeks, currently Wednesday mornings.\nResearch computing training for data science and RSE. Self-led courses on GitHub plus we run in-person and online courses during the year. Volunteer helpers welcome!\nReading group - currently reading Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath, hybrid in Royal Fort House and on MS Teams, roughly every two weeks.\nToday I Learned (TIL) GitHub repo – for making interesting things we talk about on Slack more permanent, with minimal fuss. See the ‘contributing TILs’ for instructions.\nData Science Handbook GitHub website – in development and contributions welcome!"
